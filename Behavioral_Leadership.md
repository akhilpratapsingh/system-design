## Initiative to switch to low-cost cluster in gcp compared to azure
### Situation
- I was working on a project to automate sharding for the high volume subscriptions for the platform teams.
- I noticed that the existing stage and prod clusters were on azure clusters and were expensive.
- I brought this up with my manager that as we are working on the deployment, we could also switch the cluster dependency to bring the cost down.
