# Minimize customer input in onboarding
## Situation
- Customers with large number of subscriptions had different demands. They wanted minimum intervention and as much automated onboarding as possible.
- Customers who wanted all metrics within a subscription with minimal effort.
- Hybrid onboarding. Some subs with granular control, all the rest with all metrics.
- Customers wanted to see what went wrong when the concord pipeline ran.
- Customers didn't want to chase us for approvals.
- Faster deployments.
